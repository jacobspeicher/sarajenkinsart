		"I make paper cut-outs, drawings, and paintings that conjure the impression of organisms. My artwork comes from nature where I’ve found comfort during my life. Trees release phytoncides which boost our immune systems. Fractal shapes, which are found all over nature, have a calming effect on the brain. A bacteria known as M. Vaccae, which exists in soil, increases serotonin and reduces anxiety.",
		"I cut out and draw patterns that slowly swallow everything, including itself. Multiple organisms reach for each other to cover what’s beneath such as archeological sites, landscapes, plants, and emotional states conveyed through color, marks, brush strokes, texture, sewing, and composition. I combine these with the pattern to investigate, frame, or hide those objects the way the outside world recontextualizes self-reflection. My work tries to convey the way time spent amongst the natural world affects how we perceive and process life."
