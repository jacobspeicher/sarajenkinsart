		"I make paper cut-outs, drawings, and paintings that conjure the impression of organisms. My pattern series began when I was young as a form of mental protection, comfort, and connection to the earth. The design comes from nature where I’ve found comfort during my life. Trees release phytoncides which boost our immune systems. Fractal shapes, which are found all over nature, have a calming effect on the brain. A bacteria known as M. Vaccae, which exists in soil, increases serotonin and reduces anxiety.",
		"I cut out and draw patterns that slowly swallow everything, including itself. Multiple organisms reach for each other to cover what’s beneath such as archeological sites, landscapes, and emotional states conveyed through color, marks, brush strokes, texture, sewing, and composition. The patterns investigate, frame, or hide objects the way the outside world affects us, how we’re a part of it, and how it continues after we’re gone. My series also has a connection to the Pattern and Decoration Movement. Joyce Kozloff of the P&D Movement said, “[I]f a word was used about the work . . . that had a masculine intonation, that was generally a positive review. But if you were called one of these feminine words, that was not a good thing. And one of the big no-nos was 'decorative.' . . . So then I realized, Well, what does that word mean? What are the decorative arts? They are the arts that were anonymously done by women and by people of color and people of other cultures and people who were outside of the mainstream of art history.” I use patterns to break away from patriarchal and capitalist concepts which have been used to oppress minorities and take advantage of ecosystems."
